			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Merge Project Dependencies and Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for copying the directory structure, merging requirements.txt files, and updating backend initialization files.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves straightforward file operations and dependency management with minimal technical challenges, though ensuring compatibility requires careful checking. Implementation effort is low to moderate, with basic testing."
		},

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Centralize Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for creating/updating config.py with Pydantic, handling environment variables, and integrating with dependency injection.",
			"reasoning": "Involves unifying configs across services using Pydantic, which adds moderate complexity in validation and DI setup. Dependencies on prior task and testing in environments increase effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for defining the table schema, implementing CRUD functions, adding constraints/indexes, and writing unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "Database schema changes and function implementations require careful handling of constraints and performance, with moderate technical challenges in SQLAlchemy or raw SQL. Testing adds to effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Parsing Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for defining request/response models, integrating LLM providers, adding validation and rate limiting, implementing the endpoint logic, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multi-modal input handling, LLM integration, feasibility validation, and rate limiting. Dependencies on config and DB, plus extensive testing, make this effort-intensive."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Authentication and Security",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into subtasks for applying auth middleware, implementing input sanitization and malware scanning, adding error handling with fallbacks, and security testing.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity in securing endpoints and handling security features like malware scanning and fallbacks. Depends on DB schema, with testing for unauthorized access and malicious inputs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add Caching and LLM Services",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for creating the LLM registry with fallbacks, integrating Redis caching, setting TTL and invalidation, and updating DI with testing.",
			"reasoning": "Technical challenges in caching strategies, LLM provider management, and Redis integration. Moderate to high effort with dependencies on config and endpoint, plus performance testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Brief Persistence and Retrieval",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for enhancing the parsing endpoint for saving, implementing GET endpoint for retrieval, adding refinement POST endpoint, and testing persistence and cache reuse.",
			"reasoning": "Involves DB operations and endpoint development with pagination and refinement logic. Moderate complexity due to dependencies on multiple prior tasks and integration testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Downstream Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for modifying the generate endpoint, adding auto-generation from briefs, linking briefs to DB history, and integration testing the pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate effort in linking new features to existing systems, ensuring data flow and history tracking. Depends on parsing and persistence, with end-to-end testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Update Frontend Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into subtasks for creating the editor component, building the gallery component, implementing ports for uploads, updating workflows, and manual UI testing.",
			"reasoning": "Frontend development in Elm with multi-modal features and ports adds technical challenges. Moderate to high effort, depending on backend integration, with manual testing requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Metrics, Logging, and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for integrating Prometheus and Structlog, writing comprehensive unit/integration tests, achieving coverage goals, monitoring in deployment, and cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "High effort in observability setup and extensive testing across all components. Depends on all prior tasks, with performance validation and cleanup adding to complexity."
